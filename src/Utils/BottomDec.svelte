    Icon sets are automatically kept up to date, making sure you always have
    access to the newest icons.
    <br /><br />
    If you are author of icon set that you would like to be published on Iconify,
    please <a>open an issue at GitHub repository for icon sets</a>. Icon set
    must be your own original work, it must have open source license and it must
    be published on GitHub or NPM.
    <br /><br />
    Goal of Iconify is to make using icons as simple as possible, while offering
    huge number of icons.
    <br /><br />
    Currently you can use icons in your projects as JavaScript library for browsers,
    React, Vue and Svelte components. Plug-ins for Sketch and Figma are available
    to make life of designers easier. <a>Iconify Icon Finder</a> will be
    available soon to help developers add icon piclers to their projects, such
    as website builders and website customisers.
    <br /><br />
    See <a>about Iconify page</a> to learn more about Iconify project.
