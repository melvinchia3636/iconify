    <p class="">
      There are many excellent icon sets available. Each has its own custom
      syntax, some are available only as fonts and almost all of them load
      entire set even if you are displaying just few icons.
      <br /><br />
      Iconify tries to combine all those icon sets. Iconify is a unified open source
      icon framework that makes it possible to use many icons from different icon
      sets on same page or in same application using one syntax.
      <br /><br />
      Iconify combines pixel perfect rendering of SVG with ease of use of glyph fonts,
      while offering more choice than any glyph font or SVG framework.
      <br /><br />
      You can use Font Awesome, Material Design Icons, Unicons, Dashicons and many
      other icon sets on same page or application using one syntax.
