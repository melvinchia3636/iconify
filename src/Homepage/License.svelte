            <br/><br/>
            Apache 2.0 license allows pretty much anything, including commercial use.
            <br/><br/>

            This license does not apply to icons. Icons are released under different licenses, see each collection for details. Icon collections available by default are all licensed under some kind of open source or free license, making it possible to use them in Iconify project.
